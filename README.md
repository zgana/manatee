# manatee

This is a PyGTK application for tracking time spent and counting countable
things over time.  The code seemed to work as intended last I checked, but this
should not be taken as an example of best practices.

The manual data input required for this tool is too difficult to keep up with
for it to be genuinely useful to me at this time.  Posted here nonetheless for
possible future reference.


Released under WTFPLv2.
